# This code is written to compile multiple .nt files
# into a single .nt or .txt file that can then be used for
# alignment using MEGA.
#
# USE:
#   1.) Double Click Python Script
#   2.) Enter the name you want to save as
#           Ex. "DEMO.nt" ror .nt format, or "DEMO" for .txt format
#   3.) Click 'Zip Files'
#   4.) Select Folder .nt files are located
#   5.) Enjoy the time you saved!
